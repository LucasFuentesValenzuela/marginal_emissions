# A simple data-driven method for computing marginal emissions

This repository  contains  one `.py` file and  one notebook.  

`utils.py` contains a few simple routines to extract and plot MEFs based on the data from deChalendar, PNAS, 2019. 

Please open the jupyter notebook `demo_emissions_data.ipynb` for a clear explanation of the structure of the data and of how to  extract the MEF metrics.
